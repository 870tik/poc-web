      <h2 class="sub_title" id="health">Health of Indian farmers</h2>
      <p class="main_text">Chemical fertilizers and agricultural chemicals have considerable effects on the environment and human body. Cotton is sweet for insects, and many insecticides are sprayed because it is easy for insects to attach. In addition, fertilizers must be given in order to grow it every year without rotation. We live alongside the danger of not wearing gloves and masks, and the danger of being exposed to agricultural chemicals that enter the groundwater and pump the water out of the well.<br>In 2018, the average life expectancy in India was 69 years. (according to UNICEF)<br>However, the average life expectancy of cotton growers is much younger, around 35 years. 18% of the world's pesticides and 25% of the world's pesticides are used in cotton production. This figure shows that cotton crops are sprayed with many pesticides and pesticides.
        </p>
      <h2 class="sub_title" id="income">Income of Indian farmers</h2>
      <p class="main_text">It is a fact that purchasing expensive agricultural chemicals and seeds has become a burden on Indian farmers.The purchase of chemical pesticides and genetically modified seeds, which must be purchased each year, puts a strain on income from cheap cotton sales, which depend on harvest. Some farmers go through a cycle of borrowing money and continuing to cultivate for repayment. In addition, 65% of cotton farmers in India do not have irrigation systems and rely on rainwater for their agriculture. Organic farmers, on the other hand, do not make initial investments, but instead sell their original compost or cotton grown with natural insecticides, leaving their income behind. In addition, agricultural land damaged by agricultural chemicals will recover its strength every year by organic cultivation and be reborn as a healthy field. As a result, the water retention capacity of the land will be increased and the shift to irrigation facilities using groundwater will be promoted.</p>
