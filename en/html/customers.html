        We are proud to have the world's largest production volume of both general cotton and organic cotton. (1) In India, many of the working people take up farming occupations. However, the production volume of organic cotton has hardly increased, and is only about 1% of the total production volume. On the other hand, we are increasing our presence as a sustainable cotton, <a href="https://bettercotton.org/">BCI</a> and we are increasing our production volume every year.<br><br>At first glance, cotton is a natural material that does not seem to have an impact on the environment. However, because of the use of many chemical pesticides and the need for large amounts of water, it is not a sustainable choice for the earth or for humanity to continue cultivating cotton. In order to emphasize efficiency and productivity, genetically modified seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and pesticides have been improved. Today's farming methods place a heavy burden on the environment and on Indian farmers.<br><br>However, there are many farmers who understand that cotton cultivation is not good for their health or for the earth, but are hesitant to switch to organic cotton cultivation because of concerns about reduced yields.<br>If our POC efforts help these farmers shift to organic farming, we will increase organic farming more than 1%.</p>

      <p class="main_text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-easing="ease-out-cubic" data-aos-duration="500">POC produced in cotton fields in India far away is spun into yarn overseas, then finished into products by producers around the world and delivered to us.<br>In particular, the techniques of artisans that have been handed down in the production areas of Japan bring even more value to carefully cultivated cotton, enabling us to produce cotton products that are not only friendly to the earth and people, but also have excellent quality.</p>

        In 1952, the Imabari Towel Industrial Association was established in Imabari, the largest towel production area in Japan, as the Nakashikoku-Towel Coordination Association. In the land of Imabari, blessed with a warm climate and rich water resources, we continue to pass on the techniques and dedication of our craftsmen to deliver Imabari towels of "safety, security and high quality" that meet strict quality control standards to consumers.</p>

      <p class="main_text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-easing="ease-out-cubic" data-aos-duration="500">It is said that Banshu-ori, which uses a technique called somen ori, in which threads are dyed in various colors and woven into various patterns using these colored threads, began in 1792 when the technique was brought back from Kyoto Nishijin brocade to the present Nishiwaki City, Hyogo Prefecture. Since then, it has been a local industry in the Nishiwaki area for more than 200 years, and the Banshu Textile Industrial Cooperative was established in 1947. Their advanced technology and design have earned high praise both in Japan and overseas.
